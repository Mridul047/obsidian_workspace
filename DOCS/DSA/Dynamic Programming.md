	Ways to Approach DP:
	1. Top Down: Recursion + Memoization
	2. Bottom-Up: Tabulation

	Steps to follow:
	1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index.
	2. Do all possible operations on that index.
	3. If problems says count all possible ways -> sumup all the opreations
	4. If problem says find min -> taken min. of all the oprerations
